ABOUT:

- API created with NestJs

HOW TO BUILD/RUN:

- make sure you configure your .env file as the .env.example
- make sure you run 'npm i' to install all node modules
- then simply run 'nest start' in your terminal

Issues:

- Here I intend to be completely honest with the dificulties I had during this project:
  - Prior to yesterday's Telegram message I wasn't aware of the need of RabbitMQ, I tryed to learn during this test but found out that it would take much more time than I had, so after some time investigating and trying to implement it I decided to skip that feature
  - Prior to today's test I wasn't aware of the need for Nest.Js and had never used it, so it took me some time to figure it out (I think I handled it quite well, but not as comfortably as I would be with Express.js)
  - Since I used a lot of time trying to learn RabbitMQ and NestJs, the features I applyed were much simpler than I would like to, with only a few verifications when I wanted a lot more. It also forced me to choose not to do testing, which is something I value a lot, and the avatar file handling.
